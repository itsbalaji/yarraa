Additionally, YARRAA subscribes to the practice of responsible disclosure. In the event of vulnerable information appearing online, removal of said information will take highest priority, and the breach will not be acknowledged until it has been repaired.

Our special offers are sent only to customers who grant YARRAA permission to send such information. YARRAA does not share your information with third parties and does not solicit outside parties to send special offers on our behalf. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. At the time of your order, you may opt to not receive special offers and news by un-checking the appropriate field. Furthermore, all special offers are sent via e-mail and have a \"remove link\" option should you wish to no longer receive special offers and news.

YARRAA does not share our customers' personal information with any outside parties. However, for customers who wish to opt-out or be removed from YARRAA special offers and related news, YARRAA provides several methods to accomplish this request. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by un-checking the permission to send field when processing their order. They may also send email to remove@yarraa.com with a request to be removed. Finally, they may also use the link provided with all communications to automatically unsubscribe. Clients will have the right to disclose product information directly to partners with a need to know said information; YARRAA and other third parties will not have access.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_12":"Notification of Changes",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_12":"If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If you have opted out of receiving any communications from YARRAA, you may visit our website at www.yarraa.com where news of changes will be posted. Otherwise, you may e-mail us at feedback@yarraa.com and ask our customer service department for changes and updates. If you send us an e-mail request, we will respond to that e-mail only.

	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_13":"By using YARRAA services, account-holders agree to the following terms.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_14":"Manufacturers",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_14":"Users who hold manufacturer accounts agree to register only products they make. Any manufacturers who are found to be registering products they do not produce will be blocked from further access to YARRAA, and will not receive a refund on any remaining time in their paid subscriptions.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_15":"Distributors",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_15":"Users who hold distributor accounts agree to register only products they distribute (i.e. products they either receive directly from a manufacturer or provide directly to a retailer). Distributors who are found to be registering products they do not handle will be blocked from further access to YARRAA, and will not receive a refund on any remaining time in their paid subscriptions.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_16":"Service Centres",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_16":"Users who hold service centre accounts agree to register only cases in which they were directly involved in repairs. Service centre users also agree to register only product brands and models with which they are licensed to work. Any service centre accounts that are found to contain false authorization information (i.e. claiming to be authorized for any brand or product for which the centre is not really authorized) will be blocked from further access to YARRAA, and will not receive a refund on any remaining time in their paid subscriptions. In the event that an authorized service centre is found to be listed as unauthorized (in order to save money on subscriptions or for any other reason), the centre's listing will be changed immediately to reflect its true nature and its YARRAA account will be charged to reflect the correct status. YARRAA also reserves the right to terminate the centre's account in such an instance.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_17":"Retailers",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_17":"Users who hold retailer accounts agree to register only brands they sell. As with manufacturers, failure to do so will result in immediate termination of the user's YARRAA account. Retailers also agree not to engage in unsolicited mass e-mails to consumers with contact information obtained through YARRAA. Abuse of this rule may be subject to deletion of retailers' accounts.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_18":"Consumers",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_18":"Users who hold consumer accounts agree to register only products that belong to them. Any registrations of products under a user's name that do not belong to that user, or uploading of otherwise fraudulent documents, will be grounds for immediate cancellation of the user's YARRAA account. Users understand and accept that YARRAA can be used to manage all their products, but not necessarily all brands. If a consumer purchases a product made or sold by a company that does not use YARRAA, the consumer may use YARRAA to keep track of warranty information, purchase records and the like; but services like warranty extensions and locations of service centres will not be available until and unless the company joins YARRAA. YARRAA is not responsible for any policy changes made by other companies that affect consumers' use of YARRAA services. All YARRAA ads are based on genuine consumer feedback; consumers therefore accept that their feedback may be used as representative of users' experience with YARRAA.",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_19":"All Categories",
	"PRIVACY_POLICY_ANS_19":"All users of YARRAA accept responsibility for uploading product records and other information only if said information is factually correct to the best of their knowledge. Knowingly uploading false information is grounds for immediate termination of any YARRAA account, including paid accounts.",
